### A mock technical interview undertaken on Zoom in Ruby.

Following a brief to design and build a command line to-do list application.

### Brief:

I work for ACME TODO inc

We make CL todo apps.

Every time add or complete, want to see an updated list of todos with each todo on a new line.

If there are no todos return a message to indicate this.

`add todo` with an id attached

`done #{id}` and user would then no longer see that todo

### Running tests

`rspec`
